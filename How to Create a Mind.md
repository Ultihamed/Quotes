1. Our first invention was the **story**: spoken language that enabled us to represent ideas with distinct utterances.  
2. The mathematical techniques that have evolved in the field of **artificial intelligence** are mathematically very similar to the methods that biology evolved in the form of the neocortex.  
3. There is more complexity in a **single neuron** than in the overall structure of the neocortex.  
4. Any **intelligent fool** can make things bigger and more complex. But it takes a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction. `Einstein`  
5. Nothing is at last **sacred** but the integrity of your own mind. `Ralph Waldo Emerson`  
6. One ounce (28 grams) of mass is equivalent to **600,000 tons of TNT**. `Einstein`  
7. **The brain** is a three-pound mass you can hold in your hand that can conceive of a universe a hundred billion light years across. `Marian Diamond`  
8. There are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain. Our memories are stored as **sequences of patterns**. Memories that are not accessed dim over time.  
9. Predicting the future is actually the **primary reason** that we have a brain.  
10. Human beings have only a weak ability to process logic, but a very deep core capability of **recognizing patterns**.  
11. The apparent lushness of human experience is a result of the fact that all of the hundreds of millions of pattern recognizers in our neocortex are considering their inputs **simultaneously**.  
12. Acquiring memories is very similar to building with Lego. Each assembly is equivalent to a Lego block holding some piece of elementary innate knowledge about how to process, perceive and respond to the world. When different blocks come together, they therefore form a unique combination of these innate percepts that represents an individualâ€™s **specific knowledge and experience**. `Henry Markram`  
13. [In a brain] the connections between modules are created on the whole from **experience** (nurture rather than nature).  
14. We experience the **illusion** of receiving high-resolution images from our eyes, what the optic nerve actually sends to the brain is just a **series of outlines and clues** about points of interest in our visual field.  
15. **Fear** is the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear is the beginning of **wisdom**. `Bertrand Russell`  
16. This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; **the philosophy is kindness**. `The Dalai Lama`  
17. A very important skill is the courage to pursue ideas that go **against** the grain of orthodoxy.  
18. We have already outsourced much of our personal, social, historical, and cultural memory to the **cloud**, and we will ultimately do the same thing with our **hierarchical thinking**.  
19. A computer would deserve to be called **intelligent** if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human. `Alan Turing`  
20. We are now in a position to speed up the learning process by a factor of thousands or millions once again by **migrating from biological to nonbiological intelligence**.  
21. It is difficult for us to imagine a space with more than three dimensions (perhaps four, if we include time), but **mathematics** has no such **inhibitions**.  
22. Most humans do not come up with their own **original thoughts** either but copy the ideas of their peers and opinion leaders.  
23. There are billions of neurons in our brains, but what are neurons? **Just cells**. The brain has no knowledge until connections are made between neurons. All that we know, all that we are, comes from **the way our neurons are connected**. `Tim Berners-Lee`
24. In **mathematics** you don't understand things. You just get used to them. `John von Neumann`  
25. The ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life give the appearance of approaching some essential **singularity** in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, **could not continue**. `John von Neumann`  
26. **Minds** are simply what brains do. `Marvin Minsky`  
27. **consciousness** is an emergent property of a complex physical system. By this reckoning, a computer that is successfully emulating the complexity of a human brain would also have the **same emergent consciousness as a human**.  
28. How do I know whether your experience of red is not the same experience that I have when I look at blue? We both look at a red object and state **assuredly** that it is red, but that does not answer the question. I may be experiencing what you experience when you look at blue, but **we have both learned to call red things red**.  
29. My objective prediction is that machines in the future will appear to be **conscious** and that they will be convincing to biological people when they speak of their **qualia**.  
30. It is challenging enough to put ourselves in the subjective shoes of another human, so the task will be that much harder with **intelligences that are extremely different from our own**.  
31. Before **brains** there was no color or sound in the universe, nor was there any flavor or aroma and probably little sense and no feeling or emotion. `Roger W. Sperry`  
32. We will **merge** with the tools we are creating so closely that the distinction between human and machine will blur **until the difference disappears**.  
33. If we believe that humans exhibit **free will**, then it follows that we have to allow that future versions of Watson or Watson-like machines can exhibit it also.  
34. You cannot step into **the same** river twice. `Diogenes Laertius`  
35. We are a **pattern** that changes slowly but has **stability and continuity**, even though the stuff constituting the pattern changes quickly.  
36. We have to train ourselves to think **exponentially**.  
37. If a technology is an **information technology**, the basic measures of price/performance and capacity (per unit of time or cost, or other resource) follow amazingly precise **exponential** trajectories.  
38. Exponentially expanding computational and communication technologies all contribute to the project to understand and **re-create the methods of the human brain**.  
39. If a machine can prove **indistinguishable** from a human, we should award it the respect we would to a human and we should accept that it has a **mind**. `Stevan Harnad`  
40. What used to fit in a building, and now fits in your pocket, will fit inside a **blood cell**.  
41. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an **ultra intelligent** machine could design even better machines. There would then unquestionably be an **intelligence explosion**. `Irvin J. Good`  
42. Waking up the universe, and then intelligently deciding its fate by infusing it with our human intelligence in its nonbiological form, **is our destiny**.
