1. The state of the art in computer technology is anything but **static**.  
2. It is in the nature of **exponential growth** that events develop extremely slowly for extremely long periods of time, but as one glides through the knee of the curve, events erupt at an increasingly furious pace. And that is what we will experience as we enter the twenty-first century.  
3. The further backward you look, **the further forward you can see**. `Winston Churchill`  
4. A key requirement for an evolutionary process is a **written** record of achievement, for otherwise the process would be doomed to repeat finding solutions to problems already solved.  
5. Any sufficiently advanced technology is **indistinguishable from magic**. `Arthur C. Clarke’s three laws of technology`  
6. Time is nature’s way of preventing everything from **happening at once**. `Graffito`  
7. Innovation is **multiplicative**, not additive.  
8. I find language **inadequate** for expressing my experience of **redness**.
